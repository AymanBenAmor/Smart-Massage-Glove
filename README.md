## Usage

The **Massage Glove** is designed to be a comfortable and easy-to-use wearable device that helps reduce hand tremors. Follow these steps to use the glove effectively:

### 1. **Wearing the Glove**
   - Put the glove on your hand, ensuring that the sensors and vibration motors align with the correct parts of your hand (typically the palm and fingers).
   - Make sure the glove is snug but not too tight, ensuring a comfortable fit for prolonged use.

### 2. **Powering the Glove**
   - If your glove is equipped with a power button, press it to turn on the system.
   - If the system uses an automatic on/off mechanism (based on a sensor or button press), simply wear the glove to activate it.

### 3. **Adjusting the Vibration Intensity**
   - Use the **control buttons** on the glove or the app (if applicable) to adjust the vibration intensity.
     - **Increase Vibration:** Press the **+** button to increase the intensity of the vibrations.
     - **Decrease Vibration:** Press the **-** button to reduce the intensity of the vibrations.
   - The glove will automatically adjust the vibration patterns based on the tremor detection to help reduce the intensity of hand tremors.

### 4. **Monitoring the Glove's Performance**
   - While the glove is in use, it will continuously monitor the user's hand movements and tremors.
   - The vibration motors will respond dynamically to the detected tremors and apply appropriate vibrations for therapeutic effects.

### 5. **Turning Off the Glove**
   - To turn off the glove, press and hold the **power button** or turn it off through the app (if applicable).
   - Ensure the glove is stored in a safe place to avoid damage to the internal components.

### 6. **Charging the Glove**
   - The glove is powered by a **rechargeable battery**. To charge it, connect the charging cable to the designated port on the glove.
   - Once the battery is fully charged, the glove will be ready for use again.

### **Important Notes:**
- **Comfort:** The glove is designed to be worn comfortably for extended periods. If you experience any discomfort, adjust the fit of the glove or consult the user manual for guidance on adjustments.
- **Calibration:** The glove may need to be calibrated for optimal performance based on individual tremor levels. Follow the calibration instructions provided in the manual or app.
- **Battery Life:** Battery life may vary depending on usage and vibration intensity. Charge the glove regularly to ensure itâ€™s ready for use when needed.
